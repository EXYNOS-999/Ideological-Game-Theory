# Ideological Game Theory

### Working Paper:

#### Abstract
The basis for formal game theory involves interactions between players whom possess a set of strategies that are deployed rationally. Purely rational deployment contributes to the formation of dynamic equilibria. In many cases involving human behavior, however, we have players who come from non-overlapping sets of cultural assumptions. We might be tempted to discount this variation as noise or as a factor to be incorporated into a traditional decision-making model. In this paper, we will introduce the concept of ideological game theory. Ideological game theory removes the limiting assumptions of both rationality and optimality. The main assumption involves that humans employ strategies which are empirically-based, epistemically-based, or a mixture of each (blended strategy). We will discuss the philosophical roots of this assumption, provide a generalized model of ideological games, examine a series of examples applied to existing game theory models, and then discuss the potential outcomes in terms of Dempster-Shafer theory.  

#### Introduction
The persistent belief that rational decision-making drives the world is perhaps the most questionable assumption of our everyday lives. Recently, models of irrational behavior (Lee, Amir, and Ariely, 2009) have been proposed as a way to account for the seeming chaos of collective behavior and other outcomes not easily explained by rational models. A convenient halfway point seems to be decision-making heuristics, such as models of weakly rational choice (Clark, 1994), which account for optimal outcomes given less than rational behaviors. The existence of cognitive biases certainly account for the differences between individuals, but a more comprehensive account of the game theoretic model must be established.  

The basis for ideological game theory lies in argumentation theory (van Eemeren, 2004). Argumentation theory provides a basis for human cognition as language and being rooted in language and mental constructs, as in this context argumentation is defined as a structural means to resolve cognitive discrepancies. Argumentation is an important part of human reasoning because it makes descriptions of things more explicit via a collection of propositions (van Eemeren, 2004). The functional interface between structural argumentation (the internal logic of mental constructs) and the empirical world is a form of presumptive reasoning (Visser, Vlek, and Timmer, 2004).  

Partial epistemic judgements also play a role in heuristic judgments, particularly when there is a high cost for acquiring further information. Freeman (2005) provides a number of cases in which epistemic knowledge can either play an important role in or predominate the making of decisions. These include: 1) empirical reliability of the set of beliefs in which the epistemic knowledge is rooted, 2) a suitable environment for the predominance of epistemic knowledge, and 3) whether the epistemic knowledge in question is presumed to be plausible, but further inquiry has a high cost. To make these factors salient in a game theory context, we must consider both material utility and social utility. Social utility is derived from both the cultural construction of value (Alicea, 2014) and the relationship between an empirical strategy and payoff in terms of social capital (Knack and Keefer, 1997).  

#### What makes a game “ideological”?
In a standard two-player game, each player deploys a strategy suite. Interactions of these strategies in nature determines the outcome. For our purposes, this process can be broken down into a rationalization step and an optimization step. The rationalization step involves the recognition and formulation of strategies. For example, in naughts and crosses, both players must recognize the role of turn-taking as a mutual means to organize temporal structure. While the positional placement of Xs and Os is just as important, it is merely an outcome (and consequence) of temporal structure. While the rationalization step is viewed here as subcognitive, optimization can be viewed as more explicitly cognitive. In classical game theory, it is the optimization step which generates utility (e.g. a payoff function). Using a rational decision-making framework, players often arrive at some set of optimal outcomes. These sets can be referred to as equilibria, but are generated from an oft-ignored transformation: the conversion of empirical observations into patterns of strategy deployment.

Figure 1. An example of how rationalization and optimization operate in a typical ideological game.  


To examine this conversion process in more detail, we must reconsider the relationship between sets of beliefs and sets of empirical strategies (Figure 2). More specifically, we can view this as a conditional relationship. Empirical strategies are contingent upon the strength of a player's beliefs. This conditioned response occurs during the optimization step, so that it affects the direction of optimization for a series of interactions.  

The relationship between sets of empirical strategies and sets of beliefs may not generate expected equilibria, but may instead create a different set of outcomes. When strategy deployment occurs with respect to direct empirical observations, there is a linear relationship between behavior and payoff. Players can directly observe the consequences of their gameplay and adjust accordingly. However, this does not account for reflective observations that account for a player's knowledge that may serve as a surrogate for incomplete information. This provides us with a new type of utility called semantic utility.  

Semantic utility may do much more than simply substitute prior knowledge for incomplete information. In fact, this view is in and of itself a product of rational decision-making. We can use semantic utility to characterize intercultural processes and intellectual diversity. Two players that hold different sets of beliefs play a game with an ideological bias. When one or both of these players hold beliefs so strong that they override empirical observations play a game with closed-loop epistemic bias (Figure 2, Panels C and D). In its most extreme form, closed-loop epistemic bias exhibited by one player can result in sub-optimal stable states which may make no sense to the opposing player.  

#### Ideological “tightness”
One overarching idea we must understand to appreciate the relevance of ideological game theory is that of ideological tightness. As we have shown in Figure 2, relationship between empirical and epistemic strategies consist of a series of beliefs that range from being merely influential to being highly self-referential. Related to conceptual worlds is the concept of ideological tightness. Ideological tightness involves the rigidity of linkages between beliefs and circular forms of logic.  

Ideological tightness occurs according to the following process. The first stage involves greater self-reference in the epistemic strategy suite, which is presumed to be the result of runaway confirmation bias. This results in an increasingly integrated set of epistemic beliefs. This process of integration yields a more homogeneous influence of belief on the deployment of empirical strategies, which is reminiscent of the process that yields pure strategies in classical game theory. While this influences the overall effects of ideology on empirical observations, it does not explain the pattern of mappings between certain epistemic units and certain empirically-observed units.  

Initial bias and Ideological Stochasticity. One way to model a connectionist relationship between empirical and ideological components is to begin the game with certain biases. Another way to model a connectionist relationship between empirical and ideological components is to begin the game with full connectivity, but remove weaker relationships as ideologies tighten, loosen, or the amount of variation amongst empirical observations changes.

Figure 2. A connectionist example of the relationship between sets of empirical strategies (esn) and sets of beliefs (bn) combine to yield a payoff (pn) in an ideological game. Panel A represents an optimization process that is minimally reliant upon the belief set. Panel B represents a heterogeneous optimization process, with multiple empirical strategies being conditional upon multiple beliefs. Panel C shows a closed-looped belief set with specific beliefs being conditional upon this belief set. Panel D shows an extension of C, with some beliefs (es1, es2) being outside the cultural reference frame.  


#### Payoff matrix
The advantage of ideological game theory over classical game theory can be demonstrated by examining the types of payoff matrices that can be generated by individuals with different conceptual worlds coming to the same game. In ideological game theory, the payoff matrix for a given game varies from symmetric in one of three ways: isometric non-isometric, or universal subjective. This is because the same set of empirical strategies can yield a parallel set of outcomes. These differences in quality can lead to differences in payoff for what are essentially the same set of empirical strategies.  

**Type A:** Isometric Payoff Matrix. Consists of typical optimal payoff matrix plus ideologically-consistent handicaps. This is the simplest form of alternative payoff matrix, particularly in cases where ideological factors do not overwhelm empirically-derived strategy deployment. The payoff matrix is isometric in the sense that strategy deployment is casually influenced by ideology in a way that works against players reaching an equilibrium.

**Type B:** Non-isometric Payoff Matrix. Consists of ideologies that introduce novel “hidden” payoffs. In cases where purely ideological strategies are employed, the result in a conventional payoff matrix might indeed seem nonsensical.  

**Type C:** Universal Subjective Payoff Matrix. Consists of all possible payoffs for a variety of valuation systems. For this type of payoff matrix, we flip the traditional payoff matrix on its head. What would seem to be straightforward optimal strategies are no longer such when their true (long-term or indirect) costs are considered.  

#### Blended Strategies
Combination of empirical and ideological strategy (empirical strategy with feedforward ideological information) is a blended strategy. This is not to be confused with a mixed strategy used in conventional game theory, where payers alternate between one of several potential strategies. With blended strategies, players employ empirical strategies that are influenced (constrained or favored) by epistemic strategies. While a mixed strategy yields multiple strategies that are played at certain likelihoods, these likelihoods are skewed with respect to the influence of ideological factors. 

#### Closed-loop Epistemic Bias
In a dynamic context, the proportion of blended strategies can change in favor of the epistemic contribution over time. This is due to closed-loop epistemic bias, which results from the kind of ideological tightening described in a previous section. As the epistemic strategy suite become more integrated, the closed loop is tightened, and excludes new beliefs and even ideological integration.  

**Ideological weather forecast.** One way to observe closed-loop epistemic bias is to consider what happens when things change suddenly and profoundly. This is analogous to rapid social change, but can also be modeled by using a one-player game against nature. Hence, we can engage in the following thought experiment: the weather for location x is usually dry and sunny. The lack of variation over time leads to a set of beliefs that encode this set of conditions even when there are temporary empirical deviations from the model. In this case, the player will continue to use the same model for an extended period of time regardless of the current empirical observations. The belief model is superior to the set of observations. 

Conditioned defeat and alternate realities. Another way to observe closed-loop epistemic bias is to observe play in a two-player game when one player is severely outmatched. This asymmetry of payoffs might result not from the way in which strategies are formulated and deployed, but by other factors intrinsic to the players themselves. By playing to a rational equilibrium, one player always stands to lose. In this case, it might serve the outmatched player well to play to their own goals generated from beliefs quite different from their opponent.  

#### Examples of ideological games:
**1)** Blinded Pursuit-Evasion: two player game where agents employ strategy suites either by observing the empirical world or using ideological heuristics.  

**2)** Game Against Nature: one-player game where player attempts to extract information from nature (random patterns). Strategies for extracting true positives from random patterns.  

**3)** Naughts and Crosses: two-player game where grid varies in size. Common heuristics for 3x3 grid are extended to grids of all sizes without adaptation. The empirical set of strategies involve responding to opponent in current context, while the ideological set of strategies involve sticking to heuristics.  

**4)** Tit-for-tat: one player responds to another player, but also responds to ideologically-relevant signals disconnected from material utility.

### Ideological Networks as Autocatalytic Sets:

* let M = {a,b,c,d,f,g}; F = {a,b}

* set R with following reactions: a + b --> c + d (with catalyst g), a + f --> c + b (with catalyst d), c + b --> g + a (with catalyst d and f).

* from F = {a,b} we can produce {c,d}, from {c,b} in M, we can produce {g,a}, with g and a already included in M.

* R = {a,b,c,d,g}
