# Ideological Game Theory

### Working Paper:

### Ideological Networks as Autocatalytic Sets:

* let M = {a,b,c,d,f,g}; F = {a,b}

* set R with following reactions: a + b --> c + d (with catalyst g), a + f --> c + b (with catalyst d), c + b --> g + a (with catalyst d and f).

* from F = {a,b} we can produce {c,d}, from {c,b} in M, we can produce {g,a}, with g and a already included in M.

* R = {a,b,c,d,g}
