In IGT, one unit of payoff expressed as 1 in classical PD is calculated as  

$$P(e) = 1 * \sum b_n * c_n \tag{1}$$

where P(_e_) is the probability of an empirical observation directly translating into a payoff, bn are the collective inputs of the belief units and cn are the collective inputs of the cultural constraint units. The payoff matrix is determined by the probability of an empirical observation P(_e_) being either above or below the pre-defined threshold (_e<sub>T</sub>_). P(_e_) is generally expressed as a joint probability (_e<sub>1,2,…n</sub>_). 

In general, the joint probability is greater when the collective influence of ideological and cultural constraint units are stronger. The general effect of ideological influence is to blur the distinction between discrete empirically-based decisions. In the above payoff matrix, the distinction between “share” and “no share” is only clear when ideological influence is above or below threshold contingent on the payoff in question.
