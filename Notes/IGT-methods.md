In IGT, one unit of payoff expressed as 1 in classical PD is calculated as  

$$P(e) = 1 * \sum b_n * c_n \tag{1}$$

where P(_e_) is the probability of an empirical observation directly translating into a payoff, bn are the collective inputs of the belief units and cn are the collective inputs of the cultural constraint units. The payoff matrix is determined by the probability of an empirical observation P(_e_) being either above or below the pre-defined threshold (_e<sub>T</sub>_). P(_e_) is generally expressed as a joint probability (_e<sub>1,2,â€¦n</sub>_).
