Projectability: past projections, evidence, and hypotheses.

* define a valid projection the basis of actual projections.

* outcomes (O), evidence strength (EV), and hypothesis (H). EV may or may not be weights between (O) and (H), as untrue hypotheses can be projected (beliefs supported by other hypotheses – selective sweep?).




Hypothesis will be projected when it is adopted after some of its instances are examined and determined to be true.  

* what actually is projected is not what ought to be projected.  

Two classes: evidence class and projective class.  

* evidence (supported and violated – evaluated on a case-by-case basis).  

* prediction (elimination and expansion).  

Elimination (1 and 2 are not projectable, otherwise H: is presumptively projectable):  

1) weed out all H: that have been violated (violated).  

2) weed out all H: with no unexamined instances (exhausted).  

Parents of predicate “Q” children are all H: coextensive with “Q”:  

1) entrenched predicates (some H: have more evidence than others). Draw from past projections.  

2) entrenchment does not protect a H: from upstarts.
